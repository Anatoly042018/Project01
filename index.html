    <h2>&dagger; A few facts about Jesus Christ</h2>
    
    <img src="prince of peace.jpeg" width="100">
    
        <p>He is believed to be the Jewish messiah who is prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, which is called the Old Testament in Christianity. It is believed that through his crucifixion and subsequent resurrection, God offered humans salvation and eternal life, that Jesus died to atone for sin to make humanity right with God. <br>

        These teachings emphasize that as the Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer on the cross at Calvary as a sign of his obedience to the will of God, as an "agent and servant of God". Jesus' choice positions him as a man of obedience, in contrast to Adam's disobedience. <br>

        While there has been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, Trinitarian Christians believe that Jesus is the Logos, God incarnate, God the Son, and "true God and true man"â€”both fully divine and fully human. Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin.</p>

        <h3>&dagger; Christian groups or denominations which are committed to what are considered biblically orthodox Christianity nearly all agree that Jesus:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>was born of a virgin</li>
        <li>did not sin</li>
        <li>was crucified and buried in a tomb and rose from the dead on the third day
        <li>eventually ascended back to God the Father and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming">will return to Earth</a></Li>
    </ul>
